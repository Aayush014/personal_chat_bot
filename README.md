## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get ZenAI up and running on your local environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Make sure you have Flutter installed. Instructions are available on the [Flutter official site](https://flutter.dev).
- **Gemini API Key**: Obtain an API key for Googleâ€™s Generative AI model from the Google Cloud Platform. This key will be necessary to enable AI-driven responses in the app.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aayush014/personal_chat_bot.git
   cd zenai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set Up the API Key**:
   - Open `HomeController` in your code editor.
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Google API key in the `generateResponse` method.

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   You can run the app on an emulator or a physical device. Make sure to select a device compatible with Flutter.

## Usage

### Initiating Conversations

1. **Enter a prompt**: Type any question or statement in the input field at the bottom of the screen.
2. **Send the message**: Tap the send button to initiate the AI response generation.
3. **View the response**: AI responses appear in the chat with a typing animation, creating an engaging user experience.

### Storing and Loading Chats

- **Save Conversations**: Tap the add button in the top-right corner of the app bar to store your current conversation. Your conversation will be saved with a timestamp and can be accessed from the drawer.
- **Load Previous Conversations**: Open the drawer by tapping on the menu icon. From there, select a previous conversation to load its responses into the chat window.

### Copying Responses

- To copy any response from the AI, tap the copy icon next to the response. The text will be copied to your clipboard for easy sharing.

## App Structure and Key Components

ZenAI leverages several key Flutter and GetX components for efficient state management and smooth user experience. Here is a brief overview:

- **GetX for State Management**: `HomeController` manages the entire app's state, including user inputs, chat history, and loading states.
- **GenerativeModel (Gemini API)**: Integrated to generate responses to user prompts.
- **CupertinoTextField**: Provides a user-friendly input field with Cupertino styling.
- **MarkdownBody**: Used for rendering formatted text responses in Markdown, making the content visually rich and structured.

## Dependencies

ZenAI uses the following dependencies to power its functionality and design:

- **`get`**: A lightweight state management solution for managing app state and UI updates efficiently.
- **`flutter_markdown`**: Allows AI responses to be rendered as Markdown, making responses more readable and professional-looking.
- **`google_fonts`**: Customizes the appâ€™s typography, enhancing its visual appeal.
- **`google_generative_ai`**: Integrates Googleâ€™s Generative AI model (Gemini API) for generating interactive AI responses.
